        <p>So happy I tried this new Cafe.  The coffee is amazing and the location is very cozy and convenient.  I had an iced americano and it was perfect.  Staff is also very helpful and friendly, will definitely be back soon.</p>

        <p>I had to try this place after hearing about it from a coworker.  Very impressed, service was extremely quick and the coffee was amazing.  I had a muffin also and it was just what I needed to hold me over until lunch.  Can't wait to make this place part of my morning routine.</p>

        <p>Dropped in while in town for Thanksgiving.  Hands down the best coffee I've had in the Charlotte area.  I'm a bit picky about coffee and they have it down to a science.  Menu seemed a bit short on options but the barista was happy to customize and dial in my drink just how I wanted it.  Great service.</p>
