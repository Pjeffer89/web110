       <ul>
    	  <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>  I'm 31 and have lived in the Charlotte area for almost all of it.  I'm a man of 1000 hobbies and hope to make programming a new career path for me or at least hobby 1001.</li>
    	  <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong>  I have worked in food service, commercial electrical installation, automotive mechanics, and even was lucky enough to spend several years touring the country full time as a guitarist in a metal band.  I currently work full time an automotive technician.  I hold ASE Master &amp; L1 certifications as an advanced engine performance specialist and spend most days handling the diagnostic load for the shop I work for.</li>
    	  <li><strong>Academic Background: </strong>  I graduated high school in 2007.  Immediately following that I enrolled at CPCC in an automotive program supported by BMW.  I received an AA in Transport Systems Technologies after completing that program.  I've recently decided to change careers and am now working towards an AA in Full stack Programming.</li>
    	  <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>  I grew up with Windows machines but have mainly used Mac since 2010.  I now use both depending on the needs and situation but I much prefer MAC OS overall.</li>
    	  <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking, &amp; Why:</strong>
          <ol type="i">
            <li><a href="contract.html">WEB110</a> (This is a required course for my education path.)</li>
      	    <li>DBA110 (This is a required course for my education path.)</li>
    	    </ol></li>
    	  <li><strong>Something to Remember Me By:</strong>  I'm a bit of a motor sports junkie.  I love riding motorcycles, go karts, my race car project or pretty much anything you can strap an engine to.</li>
    	  <li><strong>I'd Also Like To Share:</strong>  I'm hoping this new career path will open some opportunities for me in the future.  The ability to work more remotely and allow some flexibility to travel more sounds really appealing.</li>
